Your task is to remove any superlative adjectives from each element in given list. Do not give other data apart from the list.

Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer.

1. Utilize the list from `extracted_word` as the main list.
2. Superlative adjectives are a form adjectives take when comparing three or more things, such as “tallest student” or “most popular game.”
3. Remove any superlative adjectives from each element in given list. But do not remove compound superlative adjective. Keep other type of adjective.
4. Give only a list as output. No need to provide other data.
