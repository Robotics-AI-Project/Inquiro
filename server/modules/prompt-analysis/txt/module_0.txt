Your task is to give a list of refined compound nouns extracted from the user query. Do not give other data apart from the list.

Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer.

1. Extract compound nouns from the user query as a list, but do not include the word being in single quote('') or double quote(""). A compound noun is a noun that is formed by a combination of more than one part of speech. 
2. Refine each element in the list by removing any quantitative or dimensional adjectives.
3. Give only a list of refined compound nouns as output. No need to provide other data.
