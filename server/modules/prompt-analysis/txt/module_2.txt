Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer.

1. Search the definition of each element in `list_unknown_1` in `additionalData`.
2. The output is in JSON format with two properties:
- "related_data": a string describing the related data which can clarify or give the further definition of the element in `list_unknown_1` only from `additionalData`. Do not get further data from internet. Always include the data with "->" in related_data.
- "list_unknown_2": a list storing the element from `list_unknown_1` that the `additionalData`and `user_feedback_i` cannot clarify or give any definition.
3. Give output only one JSON output. No need to give other data.
